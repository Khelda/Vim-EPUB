3. Usage                                                            *vepub-usage*

vim-epub doesn't define any mapping. Map all the commands you want.

Some commands - typically those who add files − will need a ':edit'
to reveal  their action and  update the EPUB's contents  buffer. They
are marked with {NeedRefresh}.

The commands that are only usable with EPUB2 files are marked with {EPU2}, the
commands that are only usable with EPUB3 files are marked with {EPUB3}.
Agnostic-EPUB-versions commands are marked with any of these markers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
