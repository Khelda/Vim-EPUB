3. Usage                                                            *vepub-usage*

vim-epub doesn't define any mapping. Map all the commands you want.

Some commands - typically those who add files − will need a ':edit'
to reveal  their action and  update the EPUB's contents  buffer. They
are marked with {NeedRefresh}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Application of the commands                                     *vepub-field*

Vim-EPUB use zip.vim to open and modify an EPUB's content. At the opening of
a file, the buffer of the EPUB's file contents is provided by zip.vim.

This buffer may look like this:

	zip.vim version v27
	" Browsing zipfile /home/kaboom/test.epub
	" Select a file with cursor and press ENTER

	mimetype
	OEBPS/Images/Foo.png
	OEBPS/toc.ncx
	OEBPS/content.opf
	OEBPS/Styles/Style.css
	OEBPS/Text/Text.xhtml
	META-INF/container.xml

Some Vim-EPUB's commands are only usable on this "EPUB's content" buffer.
In this documentation, they are marked with {OnEPUBContentsBuffer}.

Some Vim-EPUB's commands are only usable on text files' buffers (xhtml…).
In this documentation, they are marked with {OnTextBuffer}.

At last, Some Vim-EPUB's commands are usable on any buffer.
In this documentation, they are marked with {OnAnyBuffer}.
