With Vim, you can already edit an epub file with the builtin zip.vim.
But it's only a RO opening. If you want to add or remove files, you need to extract and recompress the EPUB. That's boring.

With Vim-EPUB, you can:

− Add an empty page (XHTML).
− Add an empty CSS stylesheet.
− Add a Table of contents page.
− Add medias (images, etc.).
− Make your OS open the EPUB with its selected reader.
− Provide a menu to easily link XHTML and CSS contents.

See https://github.com/etnadji/vim-epub/wiki/Features for a complete list.
