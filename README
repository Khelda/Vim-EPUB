With Vim, you can already edit an epub file:

au BufReadCmd *.epub call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))

This allows you to modify the EPUB *existing* contents. But you can't add files and many other things whithout extracting the EPUB file and recompress it in 2-step.

With Vim-EPUB, you can:

− Add an empty page (XHTML).
− Add an empty CSS stylesheet.
− Add a Table of contents page.
− Add medias (images, etc.).
− Make your OS open the EPUB with its selected reader.
− Provide a menu to easily link XHTML and CSS contents.

Please note that is my first plugin. Advices, comments welcomed.
